# Hi

This is a page to showcase my public projects and organizations (which have more projects). Feel free to bookmark this page for future reference, or view it on [GitHub.](https://github.com/d3giigii/d3giigii.github.io)

# Projects

## My First Neural Network

First neural network I built using Python with Jupyter Notebook. Designed to receive a handwritten image of 0-9 as input, determine the digit the image represents, and return that digit.

Find this project [here.](https://github.com/d3giigii/myfirst_neuralnetwork)
