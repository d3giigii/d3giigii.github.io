# Hi

Hi. I'm Logan and I like to program, play games, and do math on my whiteboard on the weekends. Here you'll find some of the public projecs that I have created or contributed to; most of it will be in C++, Java, Python, or BASH.

# Projects

## Neural Network
First neural network I built using Python with Jupyter Notebook. Designed to receive a handwritten image of 0-9 as input, determine the digit the image represents, and return that digit.

Find this project [here.](https://github.com/d3giigii/myfirst_neuralnetwork)

## Prog-o-meter
Collaboratively made application that tracks personal progress during a “100DaysOf” challenge through a GUI able to save multiple users.

Find this project [here.](https://github.com/d3giigii/prog-o-meter)

## HS Dust Estimator
Command line interface tool that calculates average value of card packs given average or worst luck conditions for the collectable card game Hearthstone.
