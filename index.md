# Hi

I'm Logan, or d3giigii ("Dee three g g") online. I like to program, play games, and do math at 2 A.M. on my whiteboard on the weekends. Here you'll find public projecs that I have created or contributed to; most of it will be in C++, Java, Python, or BASH.

# Projects

## My First Neural Network

First neural network I built using Python with Jupyter Notebook. Designed to receive a handwritten image of 0-9 as input, determine the digit the image represents, and return that digit.

Find this project [here.](https://github.com/d3giigii/myfirst_neuralnetwork)
